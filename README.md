# Kotlin-Springboot-Demo
My personal playground to learn about:
- Kotlin
- Spring Boot
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Docker
- Swagger generation via SpringFox

## Docker
You can find my application also as a Docker Image here: <https://hub.docker.com/r/asteingass/springboot-demo/>

`docker pull asteingass/springboot-demo`

## Swagger
To reach the server API documentation just start the server and enter following URL: <http://localhost:8080> (this will redirect to the swagger-ui) or <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html> (for direct access)
